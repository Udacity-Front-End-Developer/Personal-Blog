# Personal Blog Website
The first submitted project for the **CSS, Website Layout, Website Components** chapter of the Udacity's Front End Developer nanodegree.

This project required me to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I did work to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

## Project Files
In this project, I've got to start from scratch! To complete the project, I was able to decide on the HTML and CSS files to include as part of my work, given that the end result is within the confines of the project rubric provided below. This should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:

- the blog website
- a blog post
- as well as any related CSS files for styling.

## Rubric
This project has been evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Personal Blog Website project specifications below.
